# Hotel Cybersecurity Best Practices for 2026

As hotels increasingly rely on connected technology, the risk of cyberattacks grows. Protecting your property and guest data is no longer optional—it's a critical operational requirement.

## The Growing Threat Landscape

Hotels are attractive targets for cybercriminals due to the volume of sensitive data they process, including:

- Credit card numbers
- Passport details
- Personal contact information
- Travel habits and preferences

## Essential Cybersecurity Measures

### 1. Secure Your Network

- **Segment guest and back-of-house networks**: Keep guest Wi-Fi completely separate from your operational systems.
- **Implement strong firewalls**: Monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Use VPNs**: Ensure secure remote access for staff.
- **Regular penetration testing**: Identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.

### 2. Protect Payment Data

- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Strictly adhere to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.
- **Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)**: Encrypt card data from the moment it's swiped/dipped.
- **Tokenization**: Replace sensitive card data with unique tokens in your PMS.

### 3. Employee Training

Human error is the leading cause of security breaches. Train staff on:
- Recognizing phishing emails
- Strong password hygiene
- Secure handling of physical devices
- Social engineering tactics

### 4. Secure Connected Devices (IoT)

Smart room controls and connected devices can be entry points for attackers.
- Change default passwords immediately
- Keep firmware updated
- Isolate IoT devices on a separate network VLAN

### 5. Data Backup and Recovery

- **Regular automated backups**: Store backups offsite and offline (immutable backups).
- **Incident Response Plan**: Have a clear plan for what to do in case of a breach.
- **Business Continuity**: Ensure you can operate manually if digital systems go down.

## Vendor Risk Management

Your security is only as strong as your weakest vendor.
- Audit third-party vendors' security practices.
- Limit vendor access to only what is necessary.
- Monitor vendor activity on your network.

## The Role of Cloud-Based PMS

Modern cloud-based PMS solutions like weleba offer enhanced security compared to legacy on-premise servers.
- Automatic security updates
- Enterprise-grade encryption
- Redundant data storage
- 24/7 security monitoring

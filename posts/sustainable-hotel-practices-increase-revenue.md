# Sustainable Hotel Practices That Increase Revenue

Sustainability in hospitality is no longer just about saving the planet—it's about saving money and attracting a growing segment of eco-conscious travelers. Here's how going green can boost your hotel's profitability.

## The Business Case for Sustainability

- **Cost Savings**: Reduced energy, water, and waste disposal costs.
- **Brand Loyalty**: 78% of travelers prefer eco-friendly accommodation.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Stay ahead of increasingly strict environmental regulations.
- **Staff Retention**: Employees prefer working for socially responsible companies.

## Revenue-Boosting Sustainable Practices

### 1. Smart Energy Management

Installing smart thermostats and occupancy sensors can reduce HVAC energy consumption by up to 40%.
*ROI Impact*: Significant reduction in utility bills directly increasing Net Operating Income (NOI).

### 2. Water Conservation

- Low-flow fixtures
- Greywater recycling systems
- "Opt-out" housekeeping programs
*ROI Impact*: Lower water and heating costs, reduced labor and chemical usage for laundry.

### 3. Waste Reduction

- Eliminate single-use plastics (toiletries, water bottles)
- Implement comprehensive recycling and composting
- Digital guest directories and check-in (reducing paper)
*ROI Impact*: Reduced purchasing costs for consumables and lower waste haulage fees.

### 4. Sustainable F&B

- Source locally to reduce carbon footprint and shipping costs
- Grow an on-site herb/vegetable garden
- Reduce food waste through better portion control and composting
*ROI Impact*: Lower food costs, higher perception of quality allowing for premium pricing.

### 5. Eco-Certifications

Obtaining certifications like LEED, Green Key, or EarthCheck.
*ROI Impact*: Access to corporate and government contracts that require green certification, plus marketing advantage.
